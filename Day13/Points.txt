Packages and Modules
--------------------
Modules
-------
Modules as libraries

modules will have the same extension as a normal python file

any python file can be considered as a module

Packages
--------
packages are same as folders or directories

packages will have modules strored inside it


packages are compared with class in oops

to create an object of a class we need a constructor __init__()

to consider a folder as a package we need __init__.py file (2.x)

when ever we inport a module from a package then __init__.py will first be executed


import a module
---------------
1. module will get converted on bytecode => .py file => .pyc file

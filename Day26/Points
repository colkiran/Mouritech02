Design Patterns
---------------
1. Creational Pattern
2. Structural Pattern
3. Behavioral Pattern


Singleton Pattern (CP)
----------------------


Factory Method (CP)
-------------------
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for
creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of
objects that will be created.

Bridge Pattern (SP)
--------------
Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or
a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction
and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
